		<h1>Deliverable D</h1>
		<p>
			Website design. From the inspirational websites i mainly used ideas for the website, what to show and in what way. My target group is potentional tourists, and/or people that like to know, and see things in different countries - Serbia. <br><br>

			I will have a black menu, with white text on it. Every page will have a nice picture as a background, and a transparent white box on which i will have text and pictures. With a footer at the bottom of the page, just like the content of it.
