				<h2>Where to stay outside Belgrade?</h2>
				<p><img id="uvac" width="220" height="350"  src="img/serbia/canyon.jpg" alt="uvac">If you wish to stay outside of belgrade, looking for some adventures, i recommend south-wester Serbia. With beautiful Canyon of river Uvac (on the picture). This is a rare area in Europe where you can see Griffon vulture which are in danger of exctintion now. Near that there is a very old Serbian Monestery called Mileseva. Inside it there is one of the oldest and most well known Serbian fresco called 'Beli Andjeo', meaning White Angel. This Monestery has been recently renovated, and know has rooms where you can stay, for a couple of days in the piece of a Monestery. Around it you will only see mountains and nature, and can be very beautiful to walk around and enjoy the freshness of it. If you arrive there at the right time of the year, you can catch rafting courses, or just rafting if you already expirienced it.<br><br>North Serbia, is an area called Vojvodina, with beautiful architecture. Most of the buildings in almost all of the towns there are very nice 17-18 century architectured buildings, and is really enjoyable walking throgh it. Or just driving around it. In the middle of Vojvodina there is a mountain called Fruska Gora, that is not very big, but amazingly on it there is 16 different Monesteries of Serbian Orthodox Church. It is really nice to see that. If you are interested in visiting Vojvodina you should stay in the Capital of Vojvodina, a city called Novi Sad. In the link below i linked the most popular hotel in Novi Sad. <br><br>
