			<h2>Sport in Serbia</h2>
				<p>Most Serbian people put a lot of pride into sports. And often we have successful sportsmen. Although not as much as we would like in football, but in other sports we could be on the very top. In World Cup for Basketball Serbian national team took second place, lost in the finals against USA. Waterpolo national team has been at the top of the world for a really long time now, rarely they would return from a big tournament without a medal. Volleyball both Men and Women are pretty good as well. World Tennis Player #1 at the moment is Novak Djokovic, a Serbian tennis player.
				 	<br><br>
				Even though our football national team is not that good, and our leauge is even worse, we still enjoy watching it. If you have a chance to go to a football match in Serbia, possibly featuring Serbian national team, Partizan or Red Star clubs, you will have fun. Although it would be wise to go with a local person that you know, becuase it can get messy during some matches.  For example the great derby of Serbian football between Partizan and Red Star is always considered a match of high risk. It is often looked upon as worlds top 5 rivlaries between football fans mostly, not the clubs themselves. If you attend that match, no matter which part of the stadion you get into, it will be a lot of fun. But my suggestion is, if you don't like adrenaline rushing through your veins, while you and everyone around you is jumping, singing and 'screaming', you probably shouldn't go then ;). Just take a look at this around 15 minute documentary about the derby it self. It is in English, so you can understand everything.
