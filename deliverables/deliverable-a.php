	<h1>Deliverable A</h1>
	<p>a) My Website will be about Serbia, the country i come from. It will be touristic, nothing to do with me, but about tourism, it will promote Serbia's advantages and try to get people to visit it. I will try to make it simple to use, nice design and show many different types of tourism in Serbia.</p>
	 
	<p>b) Meaning the people i am aiming at are people that are interested in traveling and tourism. My target group is literally from 7-77. Because on it i will show family tourism (for example some nice mountain hotel), i will also show how young people can have a lot of fun in the capital Belgrade. For example there is a very nice area in the capital, old castle with beautiful restaurants and cafes where older people can enjoy their day. Also adventurists can have fun by rafting through fast rivers of Serbia.</p>
  

	<p> c) The five websites that inspired me are:
http://www.serbia-visit.com/en  - This website has inspired me, because of the it has information that i will try to get on my website. 
The rest of the four websites are tourism based websites that just have inspirational, breath taking design, with beautiful pictures:</p>
