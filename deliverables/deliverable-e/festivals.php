				On this castle the festival is held, with many different stages, that are separated all over the castle open area. Often you will walk through some old tunnel, or cross a wooden bridge, and just have that uniqe feeling of old and new era mixing around you. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> This picture is taken at EXIT Festival:

				Another popular Serbian Festival is Belgrade Beer Fest happening in mid August. With a lot of people visiting, even though, unlike EXIT the artists that come here are more local, from Serbia and surrounding countries. On this festivals there is 1 main, really huge stage, and a couple of smaller VIP stages. Surrounding the whole area are stands with different label beers, and there is a lot of them. As you can see on the backround picture here they have Amstel, Tuborg, but also there is Heineken, Staropramen, Budweiser, and many Serbian beer labels.
